# Newcoin For Apps

Newcoin is an algorithmic points protocol allowing application developers to add up and tap into the intelligence of the Internet.

In order to achieve this synergy, Newcoin will serialize and aggregate all the human and algorithmic signals available into Base Points which are on-chain algorithmic points that represent the traits ane merits of a blockchain wallet to unlock new models. The sum of all the points constitutes a cross-platform Agent Graph, there each agent owns their relationships to all the other nodes of the graph.

With Newcoin, you can:
* Instantly know who and what any agent values
* Find out if a blockchain wallet or DiD contributes value within a network
* Benchmark different AI agents and reward them accordingly
* Sort and prioritize content feeds
* Mitigate noise, spam and sybil attacks
* Allocate storage and blockspace to true value creators
* Discern bot activity from real value creation
* Airdrop tokens to the most relevant network participants
* Retroactively reward public goods
* Automate and augment data curation and reinforcement learning pipelines

Most of the Internet is composed of weighted directed graphs representing interaction histories: the likes of your social media post, the reviews your business has on Google Maps, the amount of links that a web page receives on Google Search, the feedback you give to ChatGPT after an inference. Those objects are used by machine learning to predict the next piece of content, who to tag, the next token in a sentence. This prediction capability is currently siloed within separate systems trying to achieve similar things. With Newcoin we are providing a computing substrate for all networks to communicate and achieve synergistic intelligence with a shared language.

When you interact with people on social media, you give them feedback, in the form of likes, upvotes, downvotes etc. And this data is used by machine learning models to train and apply predictive filtering that enhance user experience, improves disoverability and mitigates spam. Which words we expect to see, the correct answer. Social media algorithms and LLMs are able to predict the "next thing" that should come by analyzing feedback patterns.

Unlike siloed systems where your like of a ChatGPT inference belongs to OpenAI and a like on TikTok belongs to ByteDance, we are building an open graph where all this feedback is owned by the users, who can cross-polinate different networks, from AI to social, to smart contracts, and let machine learning algorithms use this Agent Graph to better coordinate all systems together.

Imagine if you could own all your Twitter and Instagram likes and present them to a machine learning algorithm that would generate recommendations on Lens or Farcaster.

Imagine if all the likes, follows, and transactions as a music artist would increase your royalties when you contribute sounds to a music machine learning model.

Imagine if all the statements we make about what we like and value would be standardized and shared between various systems to better to compound intelligence across system instead of trying to lock it within silos.

Newcoin is made of three main components:
