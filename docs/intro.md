# Introducing Newcoin For Developers

Newcoin is an Agent Graph Protocol designed to establish contextual trust between agents based on how feedback.

When you interact with people on social media, you give them feedback, in the form of likes, upvotes, downvotes etc. And this data can also be used by machine learning to train and better understand what we value. Which words we expect to see, the correct answer. Social media algorithms and LLMs are able to predict the "next thing" that should come by analyzing patterns of feedback.

Unlike siloed systems where your like of a ChatGPT inference belongs to OpenAI and a like on TikTok belongs to ByteDance, we are building an open graph where all this feedback is owned by the users, who can cross-polinate different networks, from AI to social, to smart contracts, and let machine learning algorithms use this Agent Graph to better coordinate all systems together.

Imagine if you could own all your Twitter and Instagram likes and present them to a machine learning algorithm that would generate recommendations on Lens or Farcaster.

Imagine if all the likes, follows, and transactions as a music artist would increase your royalties when you contribute sounds to a music machine learning model.

Imagine if all the statements we make about what we like and value would be standardized and shared between various systems to better to compound intelligence across system instead of trying to lock it within silos.

Newcoin not only provides an open standard for this Agent Graph, similar to how SMTP works for emails, but also provides a consensus mechanism where all the points we give and receive could be aggregated and weighted in the same way tokens can be exchanged wiuthin liquid markets. 

With Newcoin, you can:
* Instantly know who and what any agent values
* Find out if a blockchain wallet or DiD contributes value within a network
* Benchmark different AI agents and reward them accordingly
* Sort and prioritize content feeds
* Mitigate noise, spam and sybil attacks
* Allocate storage and blockspace to true value creators
* Discern bot activity from real value creation
* Airdrop tokens to the most relevant network participants
* Retroactively reward public goods
* Automate and augment data curation and reinforcement learning pipelines

Newcoin is made of three main components:

<h2>Immutable Points Standard Protocol (IPSP)</h2>
An open standard for the issuance of points between agents. Points are value statements made between agents, which are the edges of the Agent Graph.
