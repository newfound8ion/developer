# Overview

The Immutable Points Standard Protocol (IPSP) represents a transformative approach to recognizing and representing value across the digital landscape, far beyond the confines of traditional financial assets. At its core, IPSP is about encoding non-monetary value—such as achievements, contributions, and influence—into a standardized, interoperable format that can be recognized and utilized across various platforms and applications. 

This protocol is fundamental to the Newcoin ecosystem and poised to impact the broader Web3 and blockchain domains significantly.IPSP introduces a system where points, akin to meta-currencies, serve as a universal language for value. Unlike traditional currencies, these points are not bought or sold; instead, they are earned through actions, behaviors, and contributions, making them a pure reflection of value created or added within a community or platform. 

This mechanism aligns closely with the intrinsic human desire for recognition and achievement, extending it into the digital realm in a way that's both verifiable and immutable.In the Newcoin ecosystem, IPSP acts as a serialization and normalization layer, bridging the gap between diverse value statements on the internet and the Agent Graph. This graph represents agents by their Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), units of content by Open Graph objects, and the relationships between them through Immutable Points, adhering to the principles laid out in IPSP. 

By doing so, IPSP not only facilitates a standardized schema for value statements but also ensures that these representations are technology-agnostic, capable of bridging or proving value across platforms, programming languages, or communication protocols.IPSP's significance lies in its potential to revolutionize how value is perceived, measured, and exchanged in digital spaces. By providing a framework for the issuance, management, and verification of points, IPSP enables a decentralized system where individuals can accumulate and own their achievements across platforms, free from the constraints and control of any single entity. This not only empowers users but also fosters a more transparent, equitable, and interconnected digital ecosystem.Moreover, IPSP's open and permissionless nature ensures that it can serve as a foundational layer for a myriad of applications, from enhancing decentralized governance and meritocratic systems to facilitating new forms of incentive structures and engagement models.

IPSP has currently two implementations:

- ** [Onchain Points](/docs/ipsp/onchain-points/) **
Onchain Points are non-transferable (soulbound) numerical (fungible) tokens that can be read by smart contracts using the rails of ERC-20 to unlock a wide range of use cases for onchain applications.

- ** [Verifiable Points](/docs/ipsp/verifiable-points/) **
Verifiable Points are offchain but cryptographically signed and therefore verifiable, using the rails of SSI and attestations. You can query them from Ceramic via OrbisDB.
