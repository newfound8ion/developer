# Quickstart

## **1. Create Activation Function**

Begin with defining the specifics of the activation function. This function will serve as the primary mechanism to activate the Newcoin system.

### **2. Propose Activation Function with WATT Type and Amount**

- Specify the type of Neural Token and the desired amount to be used in this activation function.
- Submit the Activation Function to the Encoder

### **3. Have Activation Function Approved**

Before the activation function can be used, it needs to be approved by the Newcoin Foundation.

### **4. User Runs Activate Function on Encoder and Submits ID of Approved Activation Function**

- Run the approved activation function on this encoder.
- Upon successful execution, the encoder will produce an ID for the approved activation function.
- Submit this ID for further processing and validation.

### **5. Check Conditions and Issue WATTs to User if Conditions Met**

- The Newcoin system will then validate the conditions specified in the activation function using its log of cryptographically signed credentials and the probabilistic state machine.
- If all conditions are met, the user will be issued the corresponding WATTs weighted against the Neural Tokens attributed for meeting the conditions.

### **6. WATT Can Then Be Queried**

Developers and users can now query the issued WATTs. This feature:

- Provides a universally readable numerical algorithmic identity proxy.
- Can be accessed by any smart contract, backend, or client connected to any blockchain wallet.
- Enhances crypto networks, social networks, and neural networks by providing a holistic view of a user's reputation and influence across various platforms.

### **7. Logic Provision for Other Developers and Flows On and Off Chain**

- With the acquired WATT, developers can integrate Newcoin's logic into their applications, both on-chain and off-chain.
- This enables a more interconnected and fluid experience for users and developers alike, harnessing the power of Newcoin's universal weighing mechanism for creators.
